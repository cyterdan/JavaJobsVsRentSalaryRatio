  "readme": "Supper Simple Spinner for Node.js\n=================================\n\nThis is a supper simple spinner / activity indicator for Node.js.\nI've used it in a few console tools that I've written in Node.js, where I've wanted to show that there is activity and that the program isn't hung.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/simple-spinner.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/simple-spinner/)\n\nHow Simple Is It?\n-----------------\n\nSo simple it only has 3 functions.\n\n * `start([interval in ms], [options])`\n   * Obviously this starts the spinner. You can give it how quickly you want it to go through the sequence of characters. Defaults to 250ms.\n   * **Update (2015-07-24)**: start can now also take an options object with the following keys:\n     * `hideCursor` (boolean, default: false): When true, hide the console cursor (uses TooTallNate/ansi.js)\n     * `doNotBlock` (boolean, default: false): When true, unref the timer so it does not prevent the process from exiting. \n * `stop()`\n   * I really shouldn't have to explain this one...\n * `change_sequence(sequence)`\n   * Use this if you don't like the default spinning stick. Give it an array of strings like this `[\".\", \"o\", \"0\", \"@\", \"*\"]`\n\n",

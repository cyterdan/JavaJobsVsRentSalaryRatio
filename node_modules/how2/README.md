# how2: stackoverflow from the terminal

how2 finds the simplest way to do something in a unix shell.
It's like `man`, but you can query it in natural language:

## Install
You can install it via npm:

`npm install -g how2`

if it gives you EACCES errors, [you need to fix npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions). Or you can just use `sudo npm install -g how2` if you don't care.

#### If you don't have npm
Then [just install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

#### On Ubuntu 
Install node: `sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`

Make a symlink: `ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`

Then install how2: `npm install -g how2`

#### On Mac 
Install node with brew: `brew install node`.

If you don't have brew, [download nodejs from here](https://nodejs.org)

Then install how2: `npm install -g how2`

#### If you get "/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory"
Your Linux distro (like Ubuntu) probably uses "nodejs" instead of "node". 

Make a symlink and it should work:
```ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node```

## Usage
If you don't specify a language **it defaults to Bash** unix command line.
how2 tries to give you immediately the most likely answer:

After that you can press SPACE to go to the interactive mode, where you can choose a different stackoverflow question/answer.

You can use `-l lang` to find answers for other languages:

## How does it work?
It uses Google and Stackoverflow APIs, because Stackoverflow search on its own doesn't
works as well.


## Why?
Because I can never remember how to do certain things. And reading man pages always takes too long.

* Add automatic copy/paste from -i to command line
